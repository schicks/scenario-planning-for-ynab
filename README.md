# Scenario Planning for YNAB

A scenario planning tool for YNAB that works in your local browser.

YNAB works great for allocating the money you have, but when considering making major life changes it can be hard to see what risks you are taking and how those might affect your financial health.
This tool attempts to make that easier by allowing you to make assumptions about your income and compare those to your YNAB targets, to see if your plan is realistic and to see how dramatically your day to day life would have to change.
The targets within a scenario can then be synced back to a YNAB budget, at which point you allocate money to categories within YNAB.
